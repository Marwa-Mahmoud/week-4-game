# week-4-game

- The game starts by:
 1. displaying a random number between 19 and 120
 2. assigning each crystal a hidden random value between 1 and 12 (each crystal has a different value)

- When the user presses on one of the crystals, its assinged number is added to the total score

- If the total score is equal to the random number, the user wins a point.

- If the total score exceeds the random number, the user loses a point.
